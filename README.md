nodejs + socket.io chat program I wrote during the christmas holidays in 2014. The aim was to creat a web based no-installation needed chat client. Obviously its a bit of a dead-end, since I wasn't able to create notifications or make updating seemless, but nevertheless it was very educational.

## Current state:
- development stopped when I got back from winter vacation
- probably won't work, since socket.io has been changed a lot since, and won't fit this relatively old application
- keeping repository as a collection of know-how, since I made a lot of mistakes, and hopefully I can avoid them in the future by checking this code
